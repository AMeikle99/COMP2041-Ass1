Activity: Planning/Design
Comments: I spent this time planning out how I would represent the internal structure of the legit program. This includes the folders and files I would use in tracking the File Versions.

Activity: Coding - Subset 0 (Init/Add)
Comments: I began to implement my solution that follows what is required for Subset 0. I created a way of checking the inputs are valid, implemented the Init Command and also the add command. I make use of an index folder where all staged files are kept. I may also use an 'ADDED' file to keep track of which files have been added to the index since last commit.

Activity: Coding - Subset 0 (Commit/Log/Show)
Comments: Following on from where I left off I have successfully implemented a basic version of commit (not Subset 1 standard yet). I can see myself updating how this function works when it comes to implementing merge/checkout etc. Inorder to store files correctly. I was also able to complete the show functionality. This allowed to me to employ use of REGEX when determining if filenames were valid, the arguments were of the correct format.

Activity: Coding - Subset 1 (Commit/Status)
Comments: This session I focussed on implementing the commit function with -a flag enabled. I found this task to be relatively straightforward and simple to implement. The status function is currently in development, it is proving more challenging as i require to identify which situations would lead to which status message, such as changed not staged or same as repo.

Activity: Coding - Subset 1 (Status)
Comments: I initially spent 40 mins trying to debug an issue with my Status function, whereby the comparison of two files would keep failing. After writing my own version of a compare function, to check if the one I was using may be faulty, I noticed the reason it was failing was due to my omission of a '$' in the variable name holding my directory path. After this was resolved I managed to implement the status for deleted files. I made sure to observe the output of the Reference Implementation to ensure I matched what would be expected.

Activity: Coding - Subset 1 (rm)
Comments: I spent the remaining time I had on the project completing the rm functionality. I found this tedious as it took time to work out the exact outputs produced by the reference implementation. After much trial and error I managed to produce a working copy. I also spent this time completing a few remaining test??.sh files to be submitted alongside the legit.pl file
