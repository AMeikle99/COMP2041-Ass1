Comments: I spent this time planning out how I would represent the internal structure of the legit program. This includes the folders and files I would use in tracking the File Versions.

Activity: Coding - Subset 0 (Init/Add)
Comments: I began to implement my solution that follows what is required for Subset 0. I created a way of checking the inputs are valid, implemented the Init Command and also the add command. I make use of an index folder where all staged files are kept. I may also use an 'ADDED' file to keep track of which files have been added to the index since last commit.

Activity: Coding - Subset 0 (Commit/Log/Show)
Comments: Following on from where I left off I have successfully implemented a basic version of commit (not Subset 1 standard yet). I can see myself updating how this function works when it comes to implementing merge/checkout etc. Inorder to store files correctly. I was also able to complete the show functionality. This allowed to me to employ use of REGEX when determining if filenames were valid, the arguments were of the correct format.
